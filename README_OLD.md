## Original Analysis

**Summary:** Optimized tetrameric PD-1 x CTLA-4 bispecific antibody variants with reduced immunogenicity and improved manufacturability for global market entry.

**Patentability Score:** 6.75/10
**In-Silico Score:** 9.0/10
**Gemini rNPV:** $95.0M

**Patentability Analysis:**
Cadonilimab (AK104) is prior art (approved 2022 in China for cervical cancer). Novelty relies on specific mutations reducing immunogenicity and aggregation. Patentability as a selection invention requires demonstration of unexpected technical effects (e.g., reduced immunogenicity, better stability) against the parent molecule through comparative experimental data.

**In-Silico Analysis:**
Computational validation using Boltz-2 for structure prediction, ProteinMPNN/RFdiffusion for variant design, and Aggrescan3D/DeepImmuno for developability assessment. Analysis predicts improvements in solubility, stability, and immunogenicity. Experimental validation required to confirm predictions.
