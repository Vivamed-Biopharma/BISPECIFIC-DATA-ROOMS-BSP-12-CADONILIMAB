# BSP-12-CADONILIMAB

**Summary:** Optimized tetrameric PD-1 x CTLA-4 bispecific antibody variants with reduced immunogenicity and improved manufacturability for global market entry.

**Patentability Score:** 7.0/10
**In-Silico Score:** 9.0/10
**Gemini rNPV:** $250.0M

**Patentability Analysis:**
Cadonilimab (AK104) is prior art (approved 2022). Novelty relies on specific mutations reducing immunogenicity and aggregation. Patentability is strong as a selection invention if unexpected technical effects (e.g., reduced toxicity, better stability) are demonstrated against the parent molecule, addressing known limitations.

**In-Silico Analysis:**
Excellent computational validation using state-of-the-art tools including AlphaFold3 (Boltz-2) for structure, ProteinMPNN/RFdiffusion for variant design, and Aggrescan3D/DeepImmuno for developability. Comprehensive analysis of solubility, stability, and immunogenicity supports the claims.
